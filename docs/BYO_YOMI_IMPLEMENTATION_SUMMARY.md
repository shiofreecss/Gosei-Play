# Byo-Yomi Reset Implementation - Complete ✅

## Implementation Summary

The Gosei Play server now implements **authentic Japanese byo-yomi reset behavior** according to traditional Go timing rules. This ensures competitive-level time control accuracy for serious Go gameplay.

## How Byo-Yomi Reset Works

### Traditional Byo-Yomi Rules
1. **Time Within Period**: If a player makes a move/pass within their byo-yomi time, the period resets to full time
2. **Time Exceeded**: If a player exceeds their byo-yomi time, they lose one period and get a fresh full period
3. **Final Timeout**: When all periods are exhausted, the player times out (W+T or B+T)

### Implementation Logic

```javascript
// In byo-yomi mode - check if time exceeded the period
if (timeSpentOnMove <= movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft) {
  // Move made within byo-yomi time - RESET the byo-yomi period
  movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
  log(`🔄 BYO-YOMI RESET - Player made move in ${timeSpentOnMove}s, period reset to ${gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime}s`);
} else {
  // Time exceeded - consume a period
  if (movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft > 1) {
    movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft -= 1;
    movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
    log(`⏳ BYO-YOMI PERIOD USED - Player exceeded time, used one period, ${movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft} periods remaining`);
  } else {
    // No more periods - player times out
    log(`💀 TIMEOUT - Player exceeded final byo-yomi period`);
    handlePlayerTimeout(gameState, movingPlayer);
    return; // Game ends with W+T or B+T
  }
}
```

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Authentic Reset Behavior
- **Within Time**: Move in 15s with 40s period → Period resets to 40s
- **Exceeded Time**: Move in 50s with 40s period → Lose 1 period, reset to 40s
- **Final Period**: Exceed time with 1 period left → Game ends with timeout

### ✅ Consistent Application
- Same logic applies to both **moves** and **passes**
- Time deduction only happens when actual moves/passes are made
- No continuous countdown during thinking time

### ✅ Proper Game Termination
- Automatic timeout when final period is exceeded
- Game result notation: **W+T** (White wins by timeout) or **B+T** (Black wins by timeout)
- System chat message announcing the timeout

### ✅ Real-Time Synchronization
- All clients receive immediate time updates after each move
- Consistent time state across all connected players
- Enhanced logging for debugging and transparency

## Server Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- **`server/server.js`** - Core time tracking and byo-yomi reset logic

### Functions Enhanced
1. **Move Handler** (`socket.on('makeMove')`)
   - Proper byo-yomi reset logic
   - Timeout handling with game termination
   
2. **Pass Handler** (`socket.on('passTurn')`)
   - Same byo-yomi reset behavior as moves
   - Consistent time deduction logic

3. **Timeout Handler** (`handlePlayerTimeout()`)
   - Game result notation (W+T/B+T)
   - System notifications and chat messages

### Enhanced Logging
```
🎯 MOVE TRACKED - Player made move at (4, 4) - Time spent: 00:15s (Byo-yomi)
🔄 BYO-YOMI RESET - Player black made move in 15s (within 40s limit), period reset to 40s
⏳ BYO-YOMI PERIOD USED - Player white exceeded time (50s), used one period, 4 periods remaining
💀 TIMEOUT - Player black exceeded final byo-yomi period (45s > 40s)
📤 TIME UPDATE SENT - Player black: Main=0s, InByoYomi=true, ByoYomiLeft=40s, Periods=5
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Byo-Yomi Usage
- Player enters byo-yomi with 5 periods of 40s each
- Makes moves in 10s, 25s, 35s → All periods reset to 40s
- **Result**: Efficient time usage with period resets

### Scenario 2: Period Consumption
- Player takes 50s for a move (exceeds 40s period)
- Loses 1 period, gets fresh 40s period
- **Result**: 4 periods remaining, 40s available

### Scenario 3: Final Period Timeout
- Player on final period (1 remaining)
- Takes 45s for move (exceeds 40s limit)
- **Result**: Game ends with opponent winning by timeout
